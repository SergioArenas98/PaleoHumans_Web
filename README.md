🦴 PaleoHumans: The Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens Skeletal Record in Europe

A comprehensive, open-access database and visualization tool for archaeological bone remains.

🌟 Project Overview

PaleoHumans is a scholarly web platform dedicated to cataloging, analyzing, and presenting all documented Homo sapiens skeletal and dental remains from the European Upper Paleolithic period.

The project transforms data from a static spreadsheet into a dynamic, searchable, and easily updatable relational database, providing researchers, students, and the public with an accessible tool to explore this critical palaeoanthropological record.

✨ Key Features

Interactive Database: Full-text search and advanced filtering based on archaeological, chronological, and anatomical criteria.

Anatomical Filtering: Filter the record by specific bone types (e.g., Mandible, Femur, Teeth), a key improvement over the original spreadsheet.

Geospatial Visualization: Interactive maps displaying the location of each archaeological site.

Detailed Records: Individual pages for each specimen or find, including references, dating information, and cultural/stratigraphic context.

API Access: Well-documented RESTful API for external researchers or applications.

Data Curation: Secure system for authorized users to update the database with new discoveries or revised data.

💻 Technology Stack Component Technology Rationale Frontend Angular Component-based architecture, enterprise-ready, leveraging Java/TypeScript knowledge. Backend (API) Java (Spring Boot) Fast, secure, scalable RESTful API service. Database PostgreSQL Powerful open-source relational database, ideal for modeling complex skeletal records. 📁 Data Source

The foundational data for PaleoHumans is derived from:

Title: Overview of the European Upper Palaeolithic: The Homo sapiens bone record Authors: Sergio Arenas del Amo, Núria Armentano Oller, Joan Daura, Montserrat Sanz Source: Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, 53 (2024), 104391

The original spreadsheet has been carefully normalized and modeled into a relational schema to ensure data integrity and enable advanced anatomical queries.
