  <h2>About the Project</h2>

  <p>
    This platform hosts a structured, queryable database of all known Homo sapiens skeletal
    remains from the European Upper Palaeolithic period. The dataset compiles published
    fossil evidence from approximately 248 sites, documenting around 804 individuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each entry includes detailed information about chronology, archaeological context,
    geography, skeletal representation, demographic data, and mortuary practices. The
    database provides researchers, students, and the general public with tools to explore
    spatial and temporal patterns in the Upper Paleolithic fossil record.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data is organized by cultural phases (Early, Full, and Final Upper Palaeolithic) and
    includes clear visual distinctions between directly dated specimens, indirectly dated
    materials, and uncertain chronologies.
